Guides
======

.. warning::

    This whole section is still a work in progress. There is a lot of incomplete content and some of the content that is there is not yet polished.

This is a collection of guides that address common issues in web development, specifically tailored to Django. Each guide provides solutions,
patterns, and approaches that are relevant to Django projects.
It is similar to the `Django topic guides <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/>`_, but instead of focusing on components of the
framework like ``forms``, ``models``, ``views``, etc., it focuses on more general topics like ``task queues``, ``deployment``, ``realtime``, etc.

These guides are based on my own experience and are quite opinionated. For each guide, I will share my current approach (which may change with new experiences) for
tackling the issue at hand. I will also include alternatives so that you can make your own decision. The number of guides will be limited, as this is not a blog where I post anything and
everything (for that, check out my `blog <https://oluwatobi.dev/blog>`_). Instead, this is more like a collection of recipes for common problems.
If you have feedback on the content of any of the guides, please open a `new GitHub discussion <https://github.com/Tobi-De/falco/discussions>`_. Whether you think I'm wrong about something, have suggestions for improvement,
or have a better approach to solve a specific issue, I'll be happy to hear it.

.. note::
    I want to use GitHub discussions mostly for the guides part, and issues (broken code) for the CLI part.

Most  of the stuff here is aimed at folks who are somewhere between beginners and intermediate developers, leaning more towards the intermediate side. It's kinda assumed that you've done a couple of Django projects
(like the official `Django tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/>`_). I reckon you need to be pretty familiar with the framework to feel comfortable reading these guides. But hey,
I'll do my best to make them as easy to digest as possible and provide enough external resources for a deeper understanding.

External Ressources
-------------------

Before diving into the guides, here are my top recommendations for external resources that'll help you become a better django and web
developer in general.

**The obvious ones**

        noteworthy and should not be overlooked.

        to broader your understanding of web development.
